# Environment Variables and Secrets

You can set environment variables and secrets for your flows. The main difference between both is that secrets
should be kept private and are not visible in the UI. Environment variables are visible in the UI and can be used to set default values for parameters.

If you're using `@flethy/flow` in your project you have to handle secrets by yourself. On flethy.com secrets are handled by the platform.

To access environment variables or secrets in your flow you have to use the following syntax:

- Environment variables: `==>env==>VARIABLE_NAME`
- Secrets: `==>secrets==>SECRET_VARIABLE_NAME`

## Example

An integration needs an Authorization header with a token. You can set the token as a secret and use it in your flow:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "kind": "...",
    "auth:Authorization": "==>secrets==>TOKEN"
  }
]
```
