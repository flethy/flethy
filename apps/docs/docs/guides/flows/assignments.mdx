# Assignments

Nodes are executing http requests that could response with a value. This value can be assigned to a variable on the context so it can be used in the following flow.

Add a field `config` to the node definition to assign the response to a variable.

## Assigning the full response

In the following example the response of the node is assigned to the variable `nodeResponse`.

```json
{
  "namespace": "nodeResponse"
}
```

## Computed assignments

To assign a computed value to a variable, use the `postAssignments` field.

```json
{
  "namespace": "nodeResponse",
  "postAssignments": [
    {
      "namespace": "nodeResponse",
      "key": "counter",
      "valueToEvaluate": "$number(context.thread.counter) + 1"
    }
  ]
}
```
