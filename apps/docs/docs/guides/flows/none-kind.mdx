# Kind: none

If you want to design a node without any http request you can use the special `kind` `none`. This is useful if you want to create a start node that decides which path to take.

## Example

```json
{
  "id": "start",
  "next": [
    {
      "id": "email",
      "condition": {
        "filter": "context.eventId",
        "toDecisionModel": {
          "id": "event-to-channel",
          "targetKey": "email"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "kind": "none"
}
```
