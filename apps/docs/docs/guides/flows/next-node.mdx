# Next node

In order to model a sequence, it must be possible to define the subsequent nodes.
The IDs of the subsequent nodes are added in the `next` field. For a sequential process, only add one further node.
If more than one node is added, all subsequent nodes are executed in parallel.

## Conditions

It is possible to take certain paths only if certain conditions are met.
For this purpose, an expression must be defined in the condition that can access the data of the current node.
If the expression is true, the corresponding path is taken. If there is no more path, the process is terminated.

### Example with two subsequent nodes

In the following example both nodes will be executed in parallel: `nextId1` and `nextId2`.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "nextId1"
  },
  {
    "id": "nextId2"
  }
]
```

### Example with one subsequent node and a condition

In the following example, the node `nextId1` is executed if the condition is true. An array called `thread` is available on the context. If the arrays has more than one elements (`count() > 1`) the condition becomes true.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "nextId1",
    "condition": {
      "filter": "$count(context.input.thread) > 1"
    }
  }
]
```

### Example with a match value

You can add a match value to the condition. If the match value is not equal to the condition, the path will not be used.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "nextId1",
    "condition": {
      "filter": "$count(context.input.thread)",
      "toMatch": 1
    }
  }
]
```

### Example with a decision model

You can add a decision model to the condition. If the decision model is not equal to the condition, the path will not be used.

First, you have to create a decision model:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "event-to-channel",
    "model": [
      {
        "input": "user-onboarding",
        "outputs": [
          {
            "key": "email",
            "value": true
          },
          {
            "key": "chat",
            "value": false
          },
          {
            "key": "analytics",
            "value": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Afterwards add a condition to the next node:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "email",
    "condition": {
      "filter": "context.eventId",
      "toDecisionModel": {
        "id": "event-to-channel",
        "targetKey": "email"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

With this approch you can re-use your workflow for different use cases. Depending on the event, the workflow will take different paths.
